I use AI assistance (ChatGPT) in some cases — mainly for guidance, troubleshooting errors, and clarifying how to structure certain parts of the code. The tool helped me understand concepts such as MongoDB integration etc.
I did not copy everything blindly; instead, I used the explanations to learn and then applied the solutions by modifying and writing the code myself. This allowed me to better understand backend–frontend interaction, authentication logic, and proper project setup.
